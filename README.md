# Python-Course-Work
Developed a Python program to predict student progression outcomes by prompting for credits at pass, defer, and fail. It efficiently handles multiple students, generates a histogram using 'graphics.py,' and saves data to a file. The code is clear and maintainable with user-defined functions and descriptive names.
